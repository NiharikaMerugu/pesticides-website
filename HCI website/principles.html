<h1 style="text-align:center;">PRINCIPLES OF ORGANIC FARMING</h1><br>

<p style="font-size:150%;">Organic farming methods accord with the four basic principles that reveal their essence: health, ecology, fairness, and care. They are the driving force of the concept, interrelating and enhancing each other. For instance, pesticides used in organic farming spare the ecology and do not evoke side effects in living beings, promoting health.</p>
<p style="font-size:150%;">These principles of agriculture govern all the process stages including production, processing, delivery, storage, and consumption. No prohibited additives are applied.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:left;">Health</h1><br>
<p style="font-size:150%;">The principle of health in organic farming suggests avoiding dangerous chemicals leaving poisonous residues that have a negative impact on multiple levels, affecting microscopic soil organisms, crops, animals, and humans. Expanding the common saying to agriculture, we can state that healthy soil produces healthy crops, and healthy crops foster a sound mind in a sound body – with good immunity, regeneration properties, and no disease suffered.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:left;">Ecology</h1><br>
<p style="font-size:150%;">The principle of ecology in farming involves utilizing environmentally friendly techniques like the ones fostering soil quality (preventing depletion, erosion, degradation) or eliminating nature pollution. It also means providing favorable living conditions for all ecosystem members since they closely interconnect. Eco-practices in agriculture maintain theproper balance and save natural resources, for example, restore soil fertility with non-synthetic matters (green manure and animal manures), encourage recycling and genetic diversity of species in the area</p>
<h1 style="text-align:left;">Fairness</h1><br>
<p style="font-size:150%;">The principle of fairness in organic farming advocates a decent and respectful attitude to all participants of the business: farmers, suppliers, traders, consumers. It promotes appropriate working and living conditions and supports people’s needs for sufficient supplies of quality food products.</p>
<p style="font-size:150%;">Fairness in farming also suggests providing proper feeding and environment for livestock and cattle responding to their physiology. Pricing policies should be justified and affordable.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:left;">Care</h1><br>
<p style="font-size:150%;">The principle of care in agriculture encourages sparing consumption of resources with upcoming generations and nature in mind. Applied farming technologies should be thoroughly assessed as to negative consequences. Precaution and timely risk management must govern any decision making.</p>
<p style="font-size:150%;">Even though innovations may prove efficient, the organic farming followers prefer traditional methods of agriculture validated by time. Nowadays, they combine common sense, reliable knowledge, applicable novelties, and indigenous experience dating back to the pre-chemical age.</p>

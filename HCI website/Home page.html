</table><h1>What are pesticides?</h1>
<img src="image1.png" width="600" height="300" align="right">
<p style="font-size:150%;">Pesticides are substances that are meant to control pests. 
The term pesticide includes all of the following: herbicide, insecticides nematicide, molluscicide, piscicide, avicide, rodenticide, bactericide,
 insect repellent, animal repellent, antimicrobial, fungicide, and lampricide.<br></p>
<h1>Types of pesticides</h1>
<p style="font-size:150%;">Basically pesticides  are four different types<br> they are:- <br> 
1.bactericides<br>
2.fungicides<br>
3.herbicides<br>
4.insecticides</p>
<h1>bactericides</h1>
<img src="image2.jpeg" width="600" height="300" align="right">
<p style="font-size:150%">Bactericide is a chemical agent that helps to prevent the formation of bacteria.
Bactericides are used to control corrosion caused by bacteria, such as sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB).
Bactericide is also known as bacteriocide, and is sometimes abbreviated Bcidal.<br></p>
<h1>fungicides</h1>
<p style="font-size:150%">Fungicides are pesticides that kill or prevent the growth of fungi and their spores.
They can be used to control fungi that damage plants, including rusts, mildews and blights.
They might also be used to control mold and mildew in other settings.
Fungicides work in a variety of ways, but most of them damage fungal cell membranes or interfere with energy production within fungal cells.<br></p>
<h1>herbicides</h1>
<p style="font-size:150%">herbicide, an agent, usually chemical, for killing or inhibiting the growth of unwanted plants, such as residential or agricultural weeds and invasive species.
 A great advantage of chemical herbicides over mechanical weed control is the ease of application, which often saves on the cost of labour.
<br></p>
<h1>insectides</h1>
<p style="font-size:150%">Insecticides are substances used to kill insects. They include ovicides and larvicides used against insect eggs and larvae, respectively. Insecticides are used in agriculture, medicine, industry and by consumers.
<br></p>
<p style="font-size:150%">More and more people have been embracing the idea of organic farming lately, concerned with health and environment care issues, or striving for new gastronomic experiences.
Switching to organic agriculture brings promising prospects both in terms of welfare and nature improvement as well as food diversity. Benefits of organic farming also include another significant aspect â€“ the higher nutritional value of natural food as compared to the one grown with chemical additives.
Despite higher prices, lots of consumers prefer to purchase natural products, with high demand involving the necessity of increased supplies and the exploration of organic farming practices.<br></p>
